## 🎯 How It Works

### Complete Workflow

**1. Facilitator Preparation**
```
→ Set up system (one-time, 30 minutes)
→ Define 4 critical thinking scenarios
→ Update scenarios via admin dashboard (2 minutes)
```

**2. Participant Registration**
```
→ Opens registration link
→ Enters name and phone number
→ Clicks "Register Now"
→ Gets assigned to a group (automatic, balanced)
→ Sees confirmation with group AND scenario
→ Reads: "During the session, you will work with others 
   in your group on this critical thinking task"
```

**3. During Training Session**
```
→ Facilitator uses admin dashboard
→ Sees all groups with scenarios and participants
→ Participants work on their assigned scenarios
→ Discussion, problem-solving, presentation
```

**4. After Session**
```
→ Export participant data (includes scenarios)
→ Reset for next session
→ Update scenarios for new topics
```

## 🎨 Example Scenarios

The system includes four high-quality default scenarios:

**Group 1: The Think Tank**
> "Analyze a complex business problem: A local company is losing customers despite having the best prices. What non-price factors could be causing this, and what solutions would you recommend?"

**Group 2: The Insight Collective**
> "Ethical dilemma: Your team developed an AI tool that could automate 60% of jobs in your industry. Should you release it? Discuss the trade-offs between innovation and social responsibility."

**Group 3: The Solution Studio**
> "Creative problem solving: Design a public transportation system for a city with extreme traffic congestion, limited budget, and resistance to change. What innovative solutions can you propose?"

**Group 4: The Pathfinders**
> "Critical analysis: You've been given three conflicting research reports about climate change solutions. How would you evaluate their credibility and determine the best course of action?"

**You can use these as-is or customize them instantly via the admin dashboard!**
